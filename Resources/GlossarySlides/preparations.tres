body = "It is important to always prepare yourself and those around you in case of natural disaster strikes. Doing so may help reduce loss and even save a life in dire times. One way to do so is to identifying safe locations and develop/familiarize evacuation routes in the home, school, or office.

You can also prepare by keeping in mind the the nearest active fault to your home or school by going to the following site:

Visiting this site will help you assess the vulnerability of your home to earthquake hazards such as ground shaking, landslide, liquefaction, and tsunami."
